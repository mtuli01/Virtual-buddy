# Virtual-buddy
Virtual buddy is a personal assistant designed using Python. For it's voice i just used microsoft inbuilt A.I.It is coded in a structured way so that you can easily understand and modify the code according to your need. I only tested this code on windows, but it should run on other operating systems if the required modules are installed, kindly check with the requirements file attached in the folder.

Enjoy :D
